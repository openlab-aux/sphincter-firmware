sphincter firmware
==================
arduino firmware for the [sphincter door locking system](https://github.com/openlab-aux/sphincter) used at OpenLab Augsburg

## building
The folder structure allows you to use [ino](http://inotool.org/ "project page")
for building and uploading. Just type `ino build` to build sphincter and
`ino upload` to flash it. `ino clean` removes temporary build files.
